# Tech Stack

* Background:\
The product that we are building is a web app that aims to extract body data from video clips of moguls. So based on computer vision for pose estimation, we can provide key metrics for trainers to have a deeper insight into the training performance of athletes.

* Client-Side: \
The form of our product is a web app because we would also provide a dashboard for displaying data and for some further purpose including data filtering and comparison. Hence, we would definitely use `HTML5` for structuring the web, `CSS3` for styling the web, and `JavaScript` for building the front-end logic. As for frameworks, we would use `React` because it is component-based that can keep our front-end code clean and organized. The virtual DOM of `React` also provides better efficiency in time when rendering the page. Furthermore, `React` has a greater number of users than `Vue` and `Angular`, thus have active communities for problem-spotting and problem-solving. We would also incorporate `Bootstrap` into our web app to provide an aesthetic user interface and thus to improve the user experience. The fact that `Boostrap` supports responsive site would also ease our workload if future adaptation for mobiles is needed.

* Server Side: \
For the server, we decide to mainly focus on `Python` since it is the most popular language for machine learning and our product will be focused on computer vision based on machine learning. Besides, every member of the team is proficient in `Python` and capable to contribute to both development and testing. Moreover, there are lots of machine learning libraries available for `Python` and we will be using `PyTorch`. Another factor that leads to this decision is Dr. Tsai provides us an existing solution for other sports and it is using `Python` and `PyTorch` and it is working pretty well. So we decide to stay with these tools to develop our product so that it is much easier not only for us to get started but also for our primary customer to accept and use it as a solution. Since we are building a backend server, we will also use `Flask` which is a microframework for `Python` web development. We have considered using `Django` but `Flask` is more lightweight than `Django` and `Flask` could help to keep the code simple and clean. Although `Flask` is a microframework, it has a large number of libraries and it could be as powerful as `Django` with those libraries while not containing any unwanted functionalities. As for deployment, we decide to deploy our web app on `Heroku` for the demonstration purpose of the course. The biggest advantage of `Heroku` is it is completely free but it could fulfill our needs in the early stage of development. However, it might be a good idea to deploy it in CSIâ€™s server for the production version since the data it  collects and stores could potentially contain sensitive and confidential information.
 
* Collaboration: \
We decide to use `Git` for version control since everyone in our team is familiar with it and has been using it for entire university life. We will use professional Git workflow which means there will be a release branch, a develop branch and several feature branches and all merges will be done by pull request with code review.  
 
* IDEs and other software: \
Every member of the team has their own preferred IDEs and we will be using `Visual Studio Code` and `PyCharm` for development. Also, `Postman` will be used to test our API and HTTP requests.
 
* Logistics: \
We will be using `Slack` to communicate with teaching staff and Dr. Ming and arrange meetings. All the meetings will be held in `Zoom` since it allowed us to share the screen and it helps us to practice for our demos. Moreover, we will use `WeChat` which is not listed here to communicate with other members of our team. Every member of the team is in the WeChat group and we can also send a direct message to others.
