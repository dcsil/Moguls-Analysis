## Communication:
- The primary method of communication will be a group chat created on WeChat, which includes each member of the team.
- It is difficult to make direct calls to others since people are in different countries. WeChat integrates a multiplayer voice/video call function so we will use it for emergency calls.


## Meetings:
- We will hold team meetings at least once per week.
- Meetings will be held on Zoom, which provides great functionalities for online meetings including screen sharing and recording.
- The meeting time will be discussed during the last meeting or in our group chat at least 48 hours in advance. The frequency of meetings will be decided by our team project manager based on workloads and progress. 
- All members of the team are required to attend weekly meetings. 
- We will try our best to select the time slot that everyone is available; however, in the case of absence due to unpredictable emergencies, members should let the team know as soon as possible. Then the meeting will be recorded so that the absent member won’t miss any points. 
- A summary of meetings or TODOs will be noted down by the team leader and sent to the group chat in one hour after the meeting is done.
- There might also be small meetings that are related to specific matters. In this case, not all members are required to attend, but it would be nice to have everyone there.


## Work:
- Each member is primarily responsible for their roles, and besides provides support for other people’s responsibilities when needed.
- If help from the team is needed, the member should communicate to the team in advance so that people have time to respond and help up. 
- When disputations for teamwork arise, the decision should be made based on team votes. 


## Other Issues:
- We will try our best to cooperate with others, although there might be a slight delay in communication since some of the team members are in the Asia time zone which will be a 12 or 13 hours difference in time. This will require us to communicate and act early so that members in a different timezone will have enough time to respond. A little forethought will be extremely beneficial to the whole group.
