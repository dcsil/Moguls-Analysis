Each of our team member's background contributes to the potential success of our team. We value and cherish everyone's expertise.

## Strengths

Rishi is our Singaporean friend from the team. He studies Mechanical Engineering and Product Development at NUS, so is able to combine the rigor of engineering and the creativity of business for our product. His career experience over multiple startups also brings valuable startup methodology to our team. His Indian cultural background also provides more diversity to our team.

Edward has entrepreneurial experience focusing on EdTech, knowing about corporate accounting, marketing, and event planning. His previous project experience dealing with body motion trackings provides inspiration for the underlying technology used by our product. Hence, he is also our "technical consultant" for computer vision.

Haoyu has solid experience with machine learning and statistics. He has taken several courses and done projects related to data analysis and model construction, which also provides important ML experience for the underlying technology used by our product.

Jason has participated in multiple web app and project development, and has implement software to provide solutions for actual organizations or company includes Law and Design CoLab and Cancer Care Ontario. Hence, his ability to communicate with customers to understand their actual needs and turn their needs into actual software is very useful.

Kexin has gained knowledge about product management and growth hacking during her two internships in Tencent, one for a SaaS product, and the other for a music streaming app. Hence, her insights into B2B and B2C product can be a boost to our team, directing the team towards a deliverable that reaches product-market fit.


## Weaknesses

Our product targets professional athletes and coaches, with our team vision to "help athletes stay extraordinary". However, none of our team members is with athletic experience. This makes us lacks tangible background information of our target customers' problems. Furthermore, the lack of athletic background makes attain deeper insights into the actual needs of users not that easy, while at the same time understanding the actual needs is extremely important for reaching the product-market fit.

Another weakness is that we don't have a member with UI/UX designing experience. As the progress of product design, customers sense and value good user interface and user experience, so we also need to deal with this lack of background.

### Subject Matter Experts

To address our expertise gaps, we will reach out to as many as possible subject matter experts in the athletic space, and communicate with them as frequently as possible, so as to know about their training process, their current solution for performance analysis, and their actual needs. Our main partner, CSI, which is also our main customer, will be our first choice to find SMEs from. And Dr. Tsai from CSI, who knows about athletic training and also with engineering experience, will definitely be the expert that we should communicate more with to mitigate our expertise gap in this field.

To dealing with the absence of UI/UX designers in our team, we will consult friends with designing experience and collect views from them for our propositional user interface designs. We will improve our design under their suggestions or guidance, give our customer a better experience. 

## Diversity

All members from our team come from Asia and none of us grow up in Canada, so we are not familiar with the culture of other countries. Also, there are no white people on our team and we could potentially lose the voice from some perspective. Furthermore, all of us are all university students that in the age of early 20s and we will need advice from younger and older people with different level of education since we cannot expect that all of our users are of a similar age and education. Last but not least, we hope our product could also help Paralympics athletes and we welcome people with disabilities to join our team. 


### How this can impact us

The lack of diversity will introduce potential blind spots to our product. Canada is a country of multiculturalism that our users will have a varied educational and cultural background, and they are of different race and age. We might not know the actual needs of individuals without understanding their identities and culture. Also, no one in our team is known as a member of the LGBTQ group while our user could be. There could be some unconscious bias that things that are common for us would be challenging for them. The scenario is the same for people with disabilities. We, as able-bodied, cannot imagine the life of them and there could be lots of unconscious bias make it worse and also hurt their feelings. 

All of these will have significant impacts on the usability of our product. More importantly, we respect everyone and we want every user of our product to feel respected and treasured no matter who they are. Those blind spots will not only have negative effects on our team and company but also hurt us as a person. No one wants to be an incon1siderate and insensitive person; however, sometimes we think we are thinking objectively but we are actually not. Increase team diversity will introduce opinions from other perspectives to eliminate some of the blind spots. 

The fact is there may still be some unconscious bias among our team even though we try our best to avoid them. Therefore, we will try to reach out to different people as much as we could do to correct our thoughts. We look forward to working with different kinds of people and hearing the voices of various perspectives. Although there will be some minority groups that we could not reach out to or we do not even know their existence, we will still consider their needs and improve our product consistently.
