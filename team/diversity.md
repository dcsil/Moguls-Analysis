## Strengths

He studies Mechanical Engineering and Product Development at NUS, so is able to combine the rigor of engineering and the creativity of business for our product. His career experience over multiple startups also brings valuable startup methodology to our team. His Indian cultural background also provides more diversity to our team.

His previous project experience dealing with body motion trackings provides inspiration for the underlying technology used by our product. Hence, he is also our "technical consultant" for computer vision.

Hence, his ability to communicate with customers to understand their actual needs and turn their needs into actual software is very useful.

## Weaknesses

Our product targets professional athletes and coaches, with our team vision to "help athletes stay extraordinary". However, none of our team members is with athletic experience. This makes us lacks tangible background information of our target customers' problems. Furthermore, the lack of athletic background makes attain deeper insights into the actual needs of users not that easy, while at the same time understanding the actual needs is extremely important for reaching the product-market fit.

Another weakness is that we don't have a member with UI/UX designing experience. As the progress of product design, customers sense and value good user interface and user experience, so we also need to deal with this lack of background.
