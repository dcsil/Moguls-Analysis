Team Background

Each of our team member's background contributes to the potential success of our team. We value and cherish everyone's expertise.

## Strengths

Rishi is our Singaporean friend from the team. He studies Mechanical Engineering and Product Development at NUS, so is able to combine the rigor of engineering and the creativity of business for our product. His career experience over multiple startups also brings valuable startup methodology to our team. His Indian cultural background also provides more diversity to our team.

Edward has entrepreneurial experience focusing on EdTech, knowing about corporate accounting, marketing, and event planning. His previous project experience dealing with body motion trackings provides inspiration for the underlying technology used by our product. Hence, he is also our "technical consultant" for computer vision.

Haoyu has solid experience with machine learning and statistics. He has taken several courses and done projects related to data analysis and model construction, which also provides important ML experience for the underlying technology used by our product.

Jason has participated in multiple web app and project development, and has implement software to provide solutions for actual organizations or company includes Law and Design CoLab and Cancer Care Ontario. Hence, his ability to communicate with customers to understand their actual needs and turn their needs into actual software is very useful.

Kexin has gained knowledge about product management and growth hacking during her two internships in Tencent, one for a SaaS product, and the other for a music streaming app. Hence, her insights into B2B and B2C product can be a boost to our team, directing the team towards a deliverable that reaches product-market fit.


## Weaknesses

Our product targets professional athletes and coaches, with our team vision to "help athletes stay extraordinary". However, none of our team members is with athletic experience. This makes us lacks tangible background information of our target customers' problems. Furthermore, the lack of athletic background makes attain deeper insights into the actual needs of users not that easy, while at the same time understanding the actual needs is extremely important for reaching the product-market fit.

Another weakness is that we don't have a member with UI/UX designing experience. As the progress of product design, customers sense and value good user interface and user experience, so we also need to deal with this lack of background.

### Subject Matter Experts

To address our expertise gaps, we will reach out to as many as possible subject matter experts in the athletic space, and communicate with them as frequently as possible, so as to know about their training process, their current solution for performance analysis, and their actual needs. Our main partner, CSI, which is also our main customer, will be our first choice to find SMEs from. And Dr. Tsai from CSI, who knows about athletic training and also with engineering experience, will definitely be the expert that we should communicate more with to mitigate our expertise gap in this field.

To dealing with the absence of UI/UX designers in our team, we will consult friends with designing experience and collect views from them for our propositional user interface designs. We will improve our design under their suggestions or guidance, give our customer a better experience. 

## Diversity

All members of our team were born and raised in Asia, making our team lack cultural diversity due to the absence of members with western cultural backgrounds. Also, there is no member with white or black color in our team, so we may potentially lose the voices from different racial perspectives. The lack of diversity in age generations is another concern. All of us are university students in the age of early 20s, so we need advice from younger and older people with different levels of education, since we cannot expect that all of our users are of a similar age and education. Finally, we hope our product could also help Paralympics athletes, so people with disabilities are welcomed in our team to together make our product adaptable to a wider range of athletes.


### How this can impact us

The lack of diversity will introduce potential blind spots to our product designs. Canada is a multicultural country so our users have various educational and cultural backgrounds, and are of different races and ages. We might lose deeper insights into the needs of users without understanding their identities and culture. Also, no one in our team is known as a member of the LGBTQ group while our user could be. There could result in some unconscious bias such as enforcing users to fill in gender information and to select one between "male" and "female". The scenario is the same for people with disabilities. We, as able-bodied, cannot imagine the life of them and there could be lots of unconscious bias make it worse and also hurt their feelings. It is not easy for us to fully imagine their lives, which may result in bad user experiences for those groups or may unconsciously hurt their feelings.

All of these may cause impacts on the usability or effectiveness of our product. And more importantly, those blind spots can also hurt the feelings of our users, whom we value a lot, and hope to make them feel respected. Increasing team diversity can definitely introduce more opinions from different perspectives to eliminate some of these blind spots. 

The fact is, there still exists some unconscious bias that is hard to eliminate or even to notice. We will try to reach out to various people to ask their thoughts, their experience when using the product, to fill in the holes in the lack of diversity. We look forward to working with different kinds of people and hearing the voices of various perspectives. Although there will be some minority groups that we could not reach out to or we don't know much about, we will still consider their needs and improve our product consistently.
