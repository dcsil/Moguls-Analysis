## About Kexin

Kexin is a fourth-year Computer Science student at the University of Toronto. 

Born and raised in Shenzhen, Kexin experienced the booming of the Internet in China in the last decade. She likes to play with different Internet products and tries to have some insights into their business logic. Last summer, Kexin chose to have an internship as a product manager in Tencent instead of ByteDance only for the reason that Tencent's headquarters is 15 minutes drive away from her home. 

Kexin is always eager to have an insight into the world, to learn about new things, and to take on challenges in life. Kexin loves coding and reading. Recently she is fascinated by science fiction, which drives her to take several astronomical courses at U of T. If you are also a fan of the Sci-Fi trilogy of the Three-Body Problem, then "let us be comrades".
