Leader Selection
---
Kexin is chosen as our current team leader. 

Kexin is good at communicating with the group members, and has real-life entrepreneurship experience in a tech giant as a product manager, which could be helpful in not only making decisions but also managing the whole project. Her insight and experience can be a great boost to our group.

Kexin’s experience in handling the front end of products as well as her in-depth knowledge of various development tools made her the apt choice to take on the role of team leader. She would be able to touch base with all of the individual tasks given to us as well as ensure the team’s work is directed towards the end deliverable, a marketable product. She would direct the direction of development from the business end with a keen understanding of the software enabling this. We think she can make a good plan and lead us to success.
