# Image Processing Algorithm 

The file `app.py` is a seprate server to handle image processing request from front end. We did not add this feature in the original server since it is too complicated to setup. However, you can still run this algorithm if you follow the instruction bewlow.


### Setup
1. Please follow the instruction [HERE](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) to install and build the openpose python api. 
2. Please make sure that `BUILD_PYTHON ` flag is enabled in previous step.
3. Move `app.py` to `openpose_home/build/examples/tutorial_api_python/` and now it is ready to run.
